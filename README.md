**Digital Logic Design Project**

This is the repository for my DLD project.
In  our  project, we  have  performed  addition  , subtraction  , multiplication   and  comparison  of  two  4 – bit  binary  numbers  along  with  both  hardware  and  software  implementation (LogicWorks).

**ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS :**

•	 FOR  ADDITION :

4- bit  full  adder  IC (74LS83)
5  white  Leds

•	FOR  SUBTRACTION :

4 – bit  full  adder  IC  (74LS83)
Inverter  IC  (7404)
4  green  Leds

•	FOR  COMPARATOR :

XNOR  IC (74266)
4  AND  ICS  (7408)
OR  IC  (7432)
2  Inverter  ICS (7404)
3  yellow  Leds

**•	 OTHER  MAIN COMPONENTS :**

3  Breadboards  ,  9 – volt  power  supply , jumper  wires  along  with  simple  wires  and  some  220 -300 ohm  resistors .

**SOFTWARE  USED :**

We  have  implemented  whole  circuit  of  our  project  in  LogicWorks  by  dividing  the  whole  circuit  into  several  modules  and  testing  each  circuit  operation  individually 

**WORKING :**

We  have  used  several  ICS , Leds  and  8- bit  dip  switches  in  implementation  of  project.
Addition  and  subtraction  are  performed  in  a single  breadboard  with  a  8- bit  dip  switch  that  controls  the  output  of  both  operations . 5  white  and  4  green  leds  are  used  for  this  purpose  respectively .
Similarly ,  comparator  circuit  is  done  in  two  breadboards  due  to  complexity  with  a  8- bit  switch  and  3  yellow  leds . Whenever  one  of  the  three  conditions  will  be  true  , the  respective  led  will  be  glown.

•	A > B
•	A = B
•	A < B
